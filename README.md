# Annual-Bank-of-America-Rated-Bond-Data
Time series models of rates and returns for Bank of America rated bond portfolios. The Python code fits a Markov time series model for the annual volatility, rates, and total returns, for each of the seven ratings. Results are discussed in my-finance.org posts:

We uploaded ACF and QQ plots for residuals of log Heston autoregression, and for four regressions with AAA rated bonds. Also, joint graphs of rates and wealth processes for seven ratings. To get other ratings: AA, A, BBB, BB, B, CCC, just run the code. 

Update: Added investment-grade corporate bond rates and returns from 1996. The results for these are the same as for AAA rated bonds. See https://my-finance.org/2025/04/10/annual-corporate-bank-of-america-rates/
